            <p class="c-p-one">Blue water, golden beaches fringed with coconut palms, abundant sunshine, and a tiny
                insignificant dot on
                the map – that’s, Saint Martin in Bangladesh for you. This is the most beautiful island in Bangladesh,
                hands down. This is one of the most beautiful places in Bangladesh, too. When you have 160 million
                people packed in an area equal to Illinois, you cannot expect tranquility in a beautiful place. Saint
                Martin’s is a rare exception to that because of its remote location. It’s difficult to go there, but
                once you will be there, you won’t want to leave. This is your ultimate travel guide to Saint Martin in
                Bangladesh.</p>
