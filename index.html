            <p class="c-p-one">Blue water, golden beaches fringed with coconut palms, abundant sunshine, and a tiny
                insignificant dot on
                the map – that’s, Saint Martin in Bangladesh for you. This is the most beautiful island in Bangladesh,
                hands down. This is one of the most beautiful places in Bangladesh, too. When you have 160 million
                people packed in an area equal to Illinois, you cannot expect tranquility in a beautiful place. Saint
                Martin’s is a rare exception to that because of its remote location. It’s difficult to go there, but
                once you will be there, you won’t want to leave. This is your ultimate travel guide to Saint Martin in
                Bangladesh.</p>

                Located to the southern part of Bangladesh, Saint Martin’s Island is a beautiful coral island. To many,
                Saint Martin’s is the most beautiful place in Bangladesh. We have drafted a travel guide to Saint Martin
                which includes the activities you can do, amazing photos of the island, and recommended hotels.

                Small Jetty of St Martin Island
            </h1>
            <p>
                The only way of reaching Saint Martin’s island is via ship. Our ship arrived there from Teknaf before
                noon (See below for detailed information). The jetty in Saint Martin’s is unremarkable. Several small to
                medium passenger vessels were docked there. There was a small bridge made of concrete connecting the
                island. We took our belongings from the ship and walked less than 50 meters, where a lot of vehicles
                were waiting to take the tourists to their hotel.

                The Jetty to our Hotel
            </h1>
            <p>
                We took a vehicle which is known as a “van”. It’s a three-wheeler human hauler. 4 persons can sit at the
                back, which has a shade. We did not have enough space to carry our luggage there, we somehow managed it.
                Although, the island is in the remotest place of Bangladesh; the infrastructure is fairly good. The
                placard you can see is the Government’s messages to the villagers like “Utilise the expertise of women
                during harvesting crops”.
